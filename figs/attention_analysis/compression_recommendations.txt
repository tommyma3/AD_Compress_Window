COMPRESSION STRATEGY RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

Context Statistics:
  Average sequence length: 158.7
  Maximum sequence length: 160

Attention Distribution:
  Recent context (5 steps): 4.3%
  Distant context: 95.7%

Recommended Compression Strategies:

2. ATTENTION-WEIGHTED COMPRESSION
   - Identify positions with attention > threshold
   - Keep high-attention positions, compress low-attention ones
   - Suggested threshold: top 80-90% cumulative attention

3. FIXED-WINDOW WITH SUMMARY
   - Keep recent 10 positions unchanged
   - Compress older context into fixed summary tokens
   - Use learned compression (e.g., small attention-based pooling)

4. HIERARCHICAL COMPRESSION
   - Compress at multiple intervals (e.g., every 10 steps)
   - Keep recent detail, summarize distant context
   - Progressive compression: more aggressive for older context

Implementation Suggestions:

  a) Start simple: Fixed window + attention pooling
  b) Compression interval: Every 10-20 steps
  c) Target compressed length: 47-79
  d) Preserve query token (current state) always
